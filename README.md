# D3 Force Directed Graph in Svelte

This project contains Svelte JS versions of the [D3 Force Directed Graph example](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph).

Each Svelte version is implemented as a file/component which can be tested
by modifying `src/App.svelte` to select the one you wish to try. Or you can
view the code and a live example using the 'REPL' links below.



## Svelte Implementations

1. **NetworkGraph.svelte** - uses `SVG` elements ([REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/b74876c524734666ba44cb3fa5b48e90) or [REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/01a5774b53e9416584428c025668407b?version=3.15.0) without d3-zoom)`*`
2. **NetworkGraphCanvas.svelte** - uses `canvas` with D3 hit detection ([REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/8b5800c9552440fbb51848504a3c46c9) or [REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/498b9556c3254c56a2f6c7cfc206bfb1?version=3.16.0) without d3-zoom)
3. **NetworkGraphCanvasIdContext.svelte** - uses `canvas` with a second context for hit detection ([REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/5cc46975e2c94f4d877d81b6dfbaa142) or [REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/2b1b461355204525989af7b9b191ef49?version=3.16.0) without d3-zoom)

    `*` In (1) only, I've added some axes but that's the only visual difference.

### Performance
I'm planning to add the ability to create much larger networks in order to do some
performance tests with tens to hundreds of thousands of nodes. It will be interesting 
to see how the alternative hit detection methods of (2) and (3) compare. The former uses
D3 `simulation.find()` while (3) uses a second `idContext` (drawing all the nodes a second
time and using the colour of any hit to determine which node was hit).

### Touch Screens
All should work with laptop, mobile and tablet touch screens (tested with Chrome and Firefox on Ubuntu and Android) but
note:
> It can be hard to hit the nodes with a fat finger on a small screen, so if you
> want to test or support mobile devices, you may have to enlarge the hit radius 
> when the display is a small screen.

## Get started
The conversions are based on the default [sveltejs/template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template), so refer to that for more information. 
Note though, I have modified it to use `yarn` rather than `npm`, so the 
essential commands are given below.

> *Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and `yarn` installed.*

Get the code...
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theWebalyst/d3-fdg-svelte
```

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd d3-fdg-svelte
yarn
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see the app running.

## More information 
For more information about the template used to create this app, see the README at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.
