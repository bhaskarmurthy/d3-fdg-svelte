# D3 Force Directed Graph in Svelte

This is an implementation of the D3 Force Directed Graph example which you 
can view [here](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph), 
modified to work in Svelte.

I've added some axes but that's the only visual difference. There's also 
a live [REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/01a5774b53e9416584428c025668407b?version=3.15.0).

The code in this repo is based on the default [sveltejs/template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template), so refer to that for more information. 
Note though, I have modified it to use `yarn` rather than `npm`, so the 
essential commands are given below.

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and `yarn` installed.*

## Get started

Get the code...
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theWebalyst/d3-fdg-svelte
```

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd d3-fdg-svelte
yarn
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see the app running.

## More information 
For more information about the template used to create this app, see the README at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.
